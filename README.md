# AIML-UC-Berkeley-Generative-AI
**In this project, using Generative AI, we produce text and image. Moreover, we can train image and improve its efficiency**
**We check the relative performance of different API with following prompts:**
**Instructional prompts** provide clear and specific instructions for the AI model to follow. ▪ Example: “Write a brief summary of the effect of global warming on health care.”
**Descriptive prompts** provide a description or context for AI to generate content based on. ▪ Example: “Briefly describe the steps required for addressing the effect of global warming on health care.”
**Question prompts** provide questions for AI to answer. ▪ Example: “What are the effects of global warming on health care?”
**Completion prompts** provide a partial question for AI to complete. ▪ Example: “The effect of global warming on health care can be addressed by the following steps…”
**Example-based prompts** provide an example for the type of output desired. ▪ Example: “One example of preventing effects of global warming on health care is to ‘Monitor emerging and re-emerging diseases that may be influenced by changing climate conditions.’ Provide more example on these grounds to reduce the effect of global warming on health care.”
